This is a demo of a demo that explores ideas related to structured
illumination microscopy, a superresolution microscopy technique
pioneered by Gustafsson in [2000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2818.2000.00710.x). The analogy is imperfect, but it's fun to
play with. See the included Jupyter notebook for more explanation, or use
`moire_printout.py` if you want to play with printing these out.
